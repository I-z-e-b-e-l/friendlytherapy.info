            Entries on The Therapist List are provided by members of the community, as well as providers who have submitted their information.
            <br><br>
            Clients may anonymously rate a provider's competency in a given community on a 0 - 3 scale: 
            <br><br>
            0 = completely unfamiliar   
            <br>
            3 = super comfortable and familiar.
            <br><br>
            Providers are not permitted to rate their own familiarity a given community using the rating scale, but may describe their level of competence in the comments section. 

            <!-- To order the listings in your search by freindliness to a given community, click the name of that community in bold at the top. For example, you can search "Somerville" and then click POC at the top of the window to sort all of the providers in Somerville with a friendliness rating for 3 to the top. You can click "download" to save your search results.

            Click the icon to view more information about the provider, including comments. If a field is blank, information was not provided.  -->

            This is a footer. Theoretically something goes here. Like a sitemap and a link to contact form, maybe some testimonials. Shit like that.
