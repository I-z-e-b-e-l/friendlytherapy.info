# Friendlytherapy. info
#### _A full-stack web development project, built for the community._


## ✨Overview

Friendlytherapy. info is a community project empowering Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities to make better informed decisions about our mental health care, and mitigate the difficulties in accessing providers who are knowledgeable about our identities and communities.

Entries are supplied by the community, including clients and providers. Clients are invited to rate mental health care providers they have worked with on their competency in working with communities they are a member of. Your contributions are deeply appreciated.

In an earlier incarnation, this project was known as the Boston-Area Queer/Trans/Poly/Kink/SW-Friendly Therapist List.

This iteration of the project is built by Izebel, and solves many of the shortcomings of the current friendlytherapy.info. 

## ✨Features
 - Advanced search features and filters
 - Capability to support listing providers outside of Massachusetts
 - Admin interface for editing entries

## ✨Demo
Check out a demo of the admin interface [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D7rogX_yoQ).

## ✨Tools Used
- JavaScript
- Express.js
- Node.js
- EJS
- MongoDB
- HTML
- CSS

## ✨Roadmap

I have some upcoming plans for this project including:

- Finally adding all of the user-supplied data from the older version of the project to the new database!
- Creating login access for providers to their listings, so that they can update their own information, toggle of they are currently accepting clients, etc.

## ✨Acknowledgements
This website is created by me, Izebel, with gratitude to my community.
