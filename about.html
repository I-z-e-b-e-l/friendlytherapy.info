    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <div class=faq-div>

        <h4>
            Who are you and how do I get in touch?
        </h4>
        <p>
            This website and resources are maintained by me, Izebel. Contact me <a href="contact.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Where did the list come from?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The information compiled on the list is contributed by members of Gender and Sexual Minority Communities from all over the Boston area, and many therapists. The prospect of seeking mental health care for the first time was for me, completely terrifying. I cried lot. I didn't want to deal with discrimination or judgement on top of that. So I asked friends and members of some local online communities to anonymously share recommendations through on a google form. The list exists because of people - like you! - who are willing to share info with the community.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Why don't you have info on _________?
        </h4>
        <p>
            The information collected has changed over time as I learned and understood more about community needs, and my own. If you have a suggestion, please <a href="contact.html">contact me.</a>
        </p>
        <h4>
            Can you help me find a therapist?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Check out the <a href="how-to.html">How to Find a Therapist</a> page for a step by step write up of how to go about a search. You can also check out the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.
        </p>
        <h4>
            I'm a therapist mentioned on The List and something needs to be changed or updated.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Please email me and I will update your info.

            Why is the original google sheet rainbows?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Because I like rainbows.
